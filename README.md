## Overview

A **stateful firewall engine simulator** with built-in **intrusion detection** and a **real-time GUI dashboard**.
This project demonstrates how modern firewalls track connections, inspect packets, and block malicious traffic.

---

## Demo

![Demo](assets/demo.gif)

---

## Features

- Stateful packet inspection (TCP & UDP)
- Session tracking with timeout handling
- Payload inspection:
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Command Injection
- DDoS detection (threshold-based)
- Port scan detection
- IP blocking & whitelisting
- Real-time traffic simulation
- Interactive GUI dashboard
- Attack simulation (SQL, XSS, CMD)

---

## Core Concepts

- Stateful Firewall Architecture
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Packet Filtering & Validation
- TCP State Management (SYN → ACK)
- Signature-based Attack Detection

---

## Project Structure

```
.
├── main.py
├── firewall/
├── detector/
├── simulator/
├── utils/
└── README.md
```

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eshanshverma/firewall-simulator.git
cd firewall-simulator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## GUI Controls

- **Start** — Begin packet simulation
- **Stop** — Stop simulation
- **Simulate Attack**:
  - SQL Injection
  - XSS Attack
  - Command Injection

## How It Works

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

### Packet Generation

Simulated traffic mimics real network packets.

### Validation Layer

Ensures packet structure is correct.

### Security Checks

- Detects DDoS (high packet rate)
- Detects port scanning

### Payload Inspection

Blocks malicious patterns:

- `DROP TABLE`
- `<script>`
- `rm -rf`

### Stateful Handling

Tracks TCP states: SYN → ESTABLISHED → ACK

### Decision Engine

- Allows or blocks packets
- Updates stats & logs

## Sample Output

```
[ALLOWED] 192.168.1.10 → Port 80
[BLOCKED] 1.1.1.1 → SQL Injection detected
[BLOCKED] 5.5.5.5 → DDoS suspected
```

## Feature Status

| Feature             | Status |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| Stateful Firewall   | ✅     |
| Payload Inspection  | ✅     |
| DDoS Detection      | ✅     |
| Port Scan Detection | ✅     |
| GUI Dashboard       | ✅     |

## Use Cases

- Cybersecurity learning
- Firewall/IDS demonstrations
- Academic projects
- Network security visualization

---

## Limitations

- Simulated environment (no real packet capture)
- Signature-based detection only
- No Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)

---

## Future Improvements

- Real packet capture (Scapy / pcap)
- Machine learning-based detection
- Rule-based firewall configuration
- Logging to database/files
- Web-based dashboard
